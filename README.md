## Rule-Based Chatbot
 
The chatbot uses **loops**, **input handling**, and **if-elif-else conditions** to reply to user messages.

## 💬 Chatbot Features
- Greets the user  
- Responds to basic questions  
- Uses simple keyword matching  
- Runs in a continuous loop  
- Stops when user types: **exit**, **bye**, or **quit**  
- Converts user input to lowercase for easy text matching
